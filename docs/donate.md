Multimap aims to be the fastest embedded 1:n key-value store on earth being as lightweight as possible at the same time. The development of such a library needs a lot of care and especially a lot of time. I, Martin Trenkmann, believe that money is time (I am not sure about the other direction), because it gives me the freedom to focus on projects that I find important.

If you like the library and want to support this piece of free software, buy me some time by making a little donation. Every contribution is highly appreciated. Thank you very much!
